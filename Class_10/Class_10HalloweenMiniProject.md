> Q6. Is there any variable/column that looks to be on a different scale
> to the majority of the other columns in the dataset?

The winpercent row has values that go above 1 whereas the other rows
range from only 0 to 1.

> Q7. What do you think a zero and one represent for the
> candy\$chocolate column?

I believe a 0 represents a FALSE value where the candy isn’t chocalate.
A 1 represents TRUE where the candy is chocalate.

> Q8. Plot a histogram of winpercent values

``` r
hist(candy$winpercent)
```

![](Class_10HalloweenMiniProject_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png)

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + aes(winpercent) + geom_histogram(bins = 10)
```

![](Class_10HalloweenMiniProject_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-7-1.png)

> Q9. Is the distribution of winpercent values symmetrical?

No it is skewed right towards higher winpercents.

> Q10. Is the center of the distribution above or below 50%?

``` r
median(candy$winpercent)
```

    [1] 47.82975

``` r
mean(candy$winpercent)
```

    [1] 50.31676

The center of the distribution is above 50%.

> Q11. On average is chocolate candy higher or lower ranked than fruit
> candy?

``` r
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
```

    [1] 60.92153

``` r
mean(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)])
```

    [1] 44.11974

The average for chocalate candy is higher.

> Q12. Is this difference statistically significant?

``` r
t.test(candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)], candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)])
```


        Welch Two Sample t-test

    data:  candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$fruity)] and candy$winpercent[as.logical(candy$chocolate)]
    t = -6.2582, df = 68.882, p-value = 2.871e-08
    alternative hypothesis: true difference in means is not equal to 0
    95 percent confidence interval:
     -22.15795 -11.44563
    sample estimates:
    mean of x mean of y 
     44.11974  60.92153 

The difference between the averages of chocalate and fruity candy is
statistically significant since the p-value obtained is 2.871e-08 which
is much smaller than 0.05.

> Q15. Make a first barplot of candy ranking based on winpercent values.

``` r
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(candy) + 
  aes(winpercent, rownames(candy)) +
  geom_col()
```

![](Class_10HalloweenMiniProject_files/figure-gfm/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)

> Q.16 This is quite ugly, use the reorder() function to get the bars
> sorted by winpercent?

``` r

aes(winpercent, reorder(rownames(candy),winpercent)) + geom_col()
```

Color

``` r

my_cols[as.logical(candy$bar)] = "brown"
my_cols[as.logical(candy$fruity)] = "pink"

Now, for the first time, using this plot we can answer questions like:
\> Q17. What is the worst ranked chocolate candy?

Sixlets \> Q18. What is the best ranked fruity candy?

Starburst

    increasing max.overlaps

Reese’s Miniatures

> Q20. What are the top 5 most expensive candy types in the dataset and
> of these which is the least popular?

``` r
ord <- order(candy$pricepercent, decreasing = TRUE)

Nik L Nip is in the top 5 most expensive and is the least liked at about
22.45%.

> Q21. Make a barplot again with geom_col() this time using pricepercent

Fruity, Hard, and Pluribus. These make sense since these groups are the
most unique in comparison to the other groups. Fruity, hard, and
pluribus don’t share as much with the other groups as others do for
example chocolate which shares a lot with many groups.
